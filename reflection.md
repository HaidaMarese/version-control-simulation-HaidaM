# Project Reflection

In this project, I practiced using Git and GitHub to simulate real teamwork on a coding project. Here’s what I did:

## Branching and Changes

- I created a GitHub repo called `version-control-simulation-HaidaM` and cloned it to my computer.
- I made a branch called `feature/header`, added an `index.html` file, and put in a basic header. Then I committed the changes.
- I switched to `main` and made another branch called `feature/footer`. I added a footer to the same file and committed it.

## Merge Conflict

- I merged `feature/footer` into `main` with no issues.
- Then I tried to merge `feature/header` into `main`, and a conflict happened in the `index.html` file.
- I opened the file, fixed the conflict by keeping both the header and footer sections, and committed the changes.

## Pull Request and Review

- I pushed my changes to GitHub and created a pull request from `main` to `review/main`.
- I asked **FrancesReagan** to review my pull request.
- FrancesReagan said:  
  _"Great job on fixing the conflict and cleaning up the footer. I will confirm the merge now "_
- I merged the `review/main` branch back into `main` after resolving the final conflict.

## Peer Reviews

- I received a peer review from **FrancesReagan**.

- I also reviewed **Paul Paul-Tunda**’s pull request and approved it, but I forgot to take a screenshot.

## Final Thoughts

This project helped me understand how to work with branches, fix merge conflicts, and use pull requests. Reviewing someone else’s work and getting feedback on mine felt like a real team coding experience. I feel more confident using Git now!
